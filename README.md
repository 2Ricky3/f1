## üñºÔ∏è Previous Design and After Upgrade

- **Previous Design**: The initial design provided a basic layout for driver comparison but lacked dynamic styling and interactive features. The UI was functional but minimal, focusing on essential comparison data without much visual appeal.

- **After Upgrade**: The upgraded design includes enhanced styling with CSS Modules, improved color schemes, and added interactive elements to engage users. The layout is more visually appealing, and the comparisons are presented with a cleaner, more organized structure, providing a better user experience.
